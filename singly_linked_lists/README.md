### Linked List

A linked list is a dynamic data structure in which elements are linked through pointers. Each element, also known as a node, contains a reference to the next node in the list, thus forming a linear sequence of elements. Each node in the list is composed of two parts: a part that stores the value of the element, and another that stores the reference to the next node.

Linked lists are useful when we need to store and manipulate collections of elements that can grow or shrink in size over time. Unlike arrays, linked lists do not have a fixed capacity, so we can easily add or remove elements from the list.
