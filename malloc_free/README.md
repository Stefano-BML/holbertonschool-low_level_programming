malloc is a standard library function in C that is used to allocate memory dynamically during program execution. This function allows the programmer to request a block of memory of a certain size and returns a pointer to the beginning of the allocated memory. The programmer can use this memory to store data at runtime and later release the memory when it is no longer needed using the free() function. The malloc() function is widely used in C to handle dynamic data structures and variable-sized arrays.
