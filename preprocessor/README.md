In C, a preprocessor is a program that processes the source code before it is compiled. It is a separate step in the compilation process that performs textual substitutions on the source code. The preprocessor is responsible for handling preprocessor directives such as #include, #define, and #ifdef, and it generates a modified version of the source code that is then passed to the compiler.
