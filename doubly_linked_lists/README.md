###Doubly linked lists

A doubly linked list is a type of data structure that consists of a sequence of elements, each containing a link to both its previous and next elements. This allows for efficient traversal of the list in both forward and backward directions. Additionally, elements can be easily inserted or removed from the list without having to rearrange the rest of the elements. Overall, doubly linked lists are useful for implementing various algorithms and data structures, such as queues, stacks, and hash tables. by stefano madueno
