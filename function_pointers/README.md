In C programming, a function pointer is a variable that stores the memory address of a function. It allows you to pass functions as arguments to other functions, store them in arrays, and use them to implement callbacks and event handlers. Function pointers are often used to implement dynamic dispatch, which is the ability to choose at runtime which implementation of a function to call based on the type or state of the program. Function pointers have a syntax that can be confusing at first, but they are a powerful tool that allows you to write more flexible and reusable code.
