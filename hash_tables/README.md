#Hash Table

A hash table, also known as a hash map, is a data structure used for efficient storage and retrieval of data. It consists of an array of elements, where each element is assigned through a unique hash function that maps the key of the element to a position in the array. By utilizing this mapping technique, element lookup can be done in constant time, meaning that the time taken to search for an element is independent of the number of elements in the hash table. This makes hash tables ideal for applications where fast access to data is important.
