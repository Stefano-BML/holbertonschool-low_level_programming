malloc is a standard C library function used to dynamically allocate memory during program execution. This function allows the programmer to request a block of memory of a certain size and returns a pointer to the beginning of the allocated memory. The programmer can use this memory to store data at runtime and later free the memory when it is no longer needed using the free() function. The malloc() function is widely used in C to handle dynamic data structures and variable-sized arrays.
