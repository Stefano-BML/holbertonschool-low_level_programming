In C programming, a variadic function is a function that can accept a variable number of arguments. This means that the function can be called with different numbers of arguments each time it is invoked. Variadic functions are defined using the ellipsis (...) notation in the function declaration, and the functions must use valist and related macros to handle the variable arguments at runtime. Variadic functions are commonly used in C for functions such as printf, which can take a variable number of arguments depending on the format string.
